# spaceaudio

SpaceAudio translates a movie subtitle into 16 different languages and produces a speech from it. It uses various Transformer libraries for translation and Mozilla TTS for speech generation. 

## Installation
You need python 3.8 or later.
Also I recommend you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).
